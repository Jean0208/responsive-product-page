        <h3>Behind the Dough</h3>
        <div class="behind-text-grid">
          <p>Here's the scoop from Doughp's founder on how this flavor came to be: "I first made Red Velvet on a total
            whim, just a few months into business in 2017. One day, while mixing up Doughp at our original commercial
            kitchen in Oakland, I left to grab some lunch at a nearby bakery.</p>
          <p>I saw an absolutely delicious-looking red velvet cake in their dessert case and immediately thought: I NEED
            to know what this tastes like in cookie dough! I bought the cake and mixed it right into a small 5lb batch
            of Doughp; cream cheese frosting, cake and all! HEAVEN by the spoonful!"</p>
